# wj // work journal

This is a small shell script for keeping track of time spent on different
tasks or projects.

While this README is under construction, running the script with option `-h`
should give enough information for its use.

_wj.pl is in here for historical reasons: Initially, I used a Perl version of the script, but I don't maintain it any longer._
